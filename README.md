# Prototype1 (v2) – Unity "Create with Code" Project

Hello! This is the **Version 2** rebuild of *Prototype 1* from Unity's **Create with Code** course, completed as part of my continued game development education. This version showcases improved code structure, proper commenting, and project documentation. This version will highlight my growth since the original version.

## 🎮 Project Overview

**Prototype1** is a simple driving game built using Unity. The player controls a vehicle that can move forward and turn left/right while avoiding obstacles in the environment. Let's change that :).

This project demonstrates:
- Rigidbody-based movement
- Basic input handling
- Object interaction and boundaries
- Modular and readable code practices

---

## ✨ Improvements in v2

Compared to my first version, this updated build includes:
- ✅ Clean, well-documented C# scripts
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ✅ XML summary tags for methods and classes
- ✅ Tooltip attributes for serialized fields
- ✅ Folder structure and asset organization
- ✅ Version control via Git & GitHub

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Unity physics system (Rigidbody)
- C# scripting and MonoBehaviour lifecycle
- GameObject components and transforms
- Clean code principles
- GitHub project management and collaboration readiness

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the project with Unity (2021.x or later recommended).
3. Load the scene located in `/Assets/Scenes/`.
4. Press **Play** to test the prototype.

Use **WASD or arrow keys** to move and steer the vehicle.
